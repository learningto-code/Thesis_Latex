\chapter*{Abstract}

The rapid increase in electronic waste (e-waste) necessitates an intelligent and efficient waste management solution. This study proposes a Smart IoT-Integrated Waste Management System that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance e-waste classification, monitoring, and collection. A MobileNet-based deep learning model enables real-time identification of e-waste, while IoT-enabled smart bins equipped with sensors track waste levels and optimize collection scheduling based on bin capacity and real-time traffic data. By addressing challenges such as dataset limitations, scalability issues, and low user engagement, the system improves recycling efficiency and reduces environmental impact. Additionally, a mobile application with gamification features promotes public participation in responsible e-waste disposal. The proposed solution provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to sustainable waste management in both urban and rural settings.
