abstract = {This study investigates an image recognition system for the identification and classification of waste electrical and electronic equipment from photos. Its main purpose is to facilitate information exchange regarding the waste to be collected from individuals or from waste collection points, thereby exploiting the wide acceptance and use of smartphones. To improve waste collection planning, individuals would photograph the waste item and upload the image to the waste collection company server, where it would be recognized and classified automatically. The proposed system can be operated on a server or through a mobile app. A novel method of classification and identification using neural networks is proposed for image analysis: a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to classify the type of e-waste, and a faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) was used to detect the category and size of the waste equipment in the images. The recognition and classification accuracy of the selected e-waste categories ranged from 90 to 97%. After the size and category of the waste is automatically recognized and classified from the uploaded images, e-waste collection companies can prepare a collection plan by assigning a sufficient number of vehicles and payload capacity for a specific e-waste project.}

abstract = {Mobile collection of waste electrical and electronic equipment is a collection method that is convenient for residents and companies. New opportunities to use mobile apps and internet applications facilitate the ordering of waste pickups from households and preparation of a collection plan for a waste collection company. It improves the secondary raw materials collection in a circular economy approach after recycling waste equipment. This study presents a combined methodology for improving the efficiency of e-waste collection. An online e-waste collection supporting system uses a Harmony Search algorithm for route optimization of waste collection vehicles. The results of the optimization are better compared to other artificial intelligence algorithms presented in the literature and the number of visited collection points is higher from 1.2%–6.6% depending on the compared algorithm. To increase the efficiency of waste loading and packing, a novel collection vehicle body construction is presented. The design includes the convenient loading of waste from both sides of the vehicle and the rear side being equipped with a hydraulic lift. The proposed vehicle model can be used for e-waste collection in places with limited parking spaces or where the parking time is limited, such as in densely populated city centers. The waste equipment packing efficiency increases and eliminates the necessity of including a container loading problem in the algorithm and allows increasing waste equipment number loaded in a collection vehicle.}
